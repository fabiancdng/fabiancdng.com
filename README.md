### Deployment with Docker

My website can be deployed using a single Docker image:

- [`fabiancdng-website`](https://github.com/fabiancdng/fabiancdng.com/pkgs/container/fabiancdng-website) - Next.js front end

There's a continuous build of the Docker image up on the Github container registry. You can build it yourself, however, using the Dockerfile provided in the repository.
